# Internet

The Internet is a global network of computers connected to each other that communicate through a standardized set of protocols.

It is made up of a large number of independently operated networks and is fully distributed there is no central control.

## Transfer of Data on The Internet

Information on the internet moves from one computer to another in the form of **bits** over various mediums, including ethernet cables, fiber optic cables, and wireless signals.

The data is broken down into smaller units called **packets**.

A packet has two parts. The **header** contains information that helps the packet get to its destination, including the length of the packet, its source and destination, and a checksum value.

**Bits** can be described as an **‚ÄúON‚Äù** or **‚ÄúOFF‚Äù**. 1 means ON and 0 means OFF.

**Bit Rate ‚Äî** It is the number of bits that we can actually send over a given period of time. It is measured in seconds.

**Latency** **‚Äî** It is the amount of time it takes for one bit to travel from one place to another.

The packets need not follow a fixed path, the path may change. The **routers** are responsible for the transfer of packets, and it chooses the cheapest path available.

### Protocols

It is a well-known set of rules and standards used to communicate between machines.

**TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** ‚Äî The TCP protocol is responsible for the sending and receiving of data packets.

**HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)** ‚Äî HTTP is the standard protocol by which webpages are transferred over the internet.

**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** ‚Äî HTML is the language used to tell a web browser how to make a page look.

**SSL (Secure Socket Layer)** ‚Äî The SSL protocol is used to establish a secure connection over the internet between two devices over the HTTP protocol.

## IP Addresses

Internet Protocol (IP) addresses are numbers that computers used to identify each other on the internet.

The Most Important protocol used in the computer networks is called the **IPv4** (Internet Protocol Version 4). It is of 32 bits.

<aside>
üí° The **ICANN** (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) department is responsible for distributing IP addresses to ensure two different systems don‚Äôt use the same address.

## DNS (Domain Name System)

The Domain Name System is the hierarchical and decentralized naming system used to identify computers, services, and other devices on the internet.

DNS servers are connected in a distributed hierarchy and are divided into zones splitting up the responsibility for the major domains such as .org, .com, .net, etc.

## Cryptography

Cryptography is the method of securing a connection between two devices over the internet. It involves two methods:

1. **Encryption** ‚Äî In this process, the original message is changed to some random set of characters.
2. **Decryption** ‚Äî It is the process of un-scrambling the encrypted message to make it human-readable.
